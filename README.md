# Supply Chain Partition Optimization Program

This is a production planning system that uses constraint programming to partition orders to different suppliers. The execution script will ask users for an excel file to input orders and supplier data and the script will run the partitioning algorithm based on user parameters and output the result in a corresponding xlsx file. 

Note:
This system was built specifically for use at Kanetop Co. for production planning within the garment manufacturing system. It is not a general all-purpose algorithm.
